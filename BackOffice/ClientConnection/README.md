# ClientConnection

Here is our CDK deployment of our client VPN connection components. This is all the stuff that we deploy into the VPC that was deployed as part of the BaseInfra stack.

This app deploys the AD Connector, and the Client VPN service. It requires that the BaseInfra stack is already deployed.
